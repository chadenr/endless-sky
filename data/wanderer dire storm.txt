	description "The Dire Storm is a deep space command, control and science vessel, designed to be one of the first ships through the Eye, to begin cataloging the dangers of the unknown space beyond, and to provide a secure, mobile headquarters for the warships that stay behind to cover the Wanderers' retreat. Endless banks of climate-controlled storage allow the dozen (or so) science labs to take hundreds of soil, water and even biological specimens from desolate worlds. Four drones allow remote, efficient harvesting and in an emergency can provide cover for a fleet of ships."
